# FUZ CLI (FUCK YOU ZERODHA) by @IndianStreetBets

This project is result of frustration towards Zerodha API. Even for basic API access they are ripping off customers. So, i whipped up a code in an hour or two to get full access to Zerodha API without requiring API Keys. 
The FUZ CLI uses 'Encryption token' method to login to your account. 

# FUZ CLI - WHAT, WHY, WHO.

What : A command-line interface for interacting with the Zerodha trading platform.
Why : Why the fuck not.
Who : Mainly for developers to develop tools on top of it but it can be used by regular end users as well. Functionality has been added .... or atleast i have tried. 

## Project Description

This CLI tool allows users to analyze stocks, manage watchlists, set alerts, and screen stocks based on technical indicators, all from the command line.

## Features

- Stock Analysis
- Market Overview
- Watchlist Management
- Alert System

## Current Issues 

- Improve response time
  
## Usage 

This tool is intended for the use of developers and algo traders however end users can still use the features as per usage guide.

## Next steps

- Introduce order placement and order management. 
- Improve current features.
- Remove dependancy of websocket from Zerodha and only use Zerodha websocket for order management.
- Introduce a global scraper to get real-time updates regarding News, Inside buys, Volume spikes, corporate announcements, other events.

## Collaboration

As this is a collaborative effort, algo traders and devs, i request you to provide feedback to improve this further. You can reach out to me on IndianStreetBets Discord server.
