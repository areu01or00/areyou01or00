# FUZ CLI (FUCK YOU ZERODHA) by @IndianStreetBets

This project is result of frustration towards Zerodha API. Even for basic API access they are ripping off customers. So, i whipped up a code in an hour or two to get full access to Zerodha API without requiring API Keys. 
The FUZ CLI uses 'Encryption token' method to login to your account. 

# FUZ CLI - WHAT, WHY, WHO.

What : A command-line interface for interacting with the Zerodha trading platform.
Why : Why the fuck not.
Who : Mainly for developers to develop tools on top of it but it can be used by regular end users as well. Functionality has been added .... or atleast i have tried.
